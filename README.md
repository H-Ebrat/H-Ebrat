# Hey, I'm Haris 👋

From trading desks to smart contracts. I spent years as a financial analyst and trader before diving into Web3 in 2022. After working across different areas of the industry, I realized I wanted to understand how everything actually works under the hood—so I taught myself Solidity.

## 💼 What I Do

I'm a Solidity developer focused on **DeFi protocol architecture** and **security**. I split my time between building smart contracts and helping Web3 projects grow their ecosystems.

My finance background gives me a different lens on DeFi—I understand both the financial mechanics and the technical implementation. That combination is what I bring to every protocol I work on.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- 🏗️ Deep diving into DeFi protocol design patterns and architecture
- 🔐 Security-first smart contract development
- 📚 Learning from Cyfrin Updraft and Alchemy University
- ⚡ Building with Foundry for testing and deployment

**Long-term goal:** 🚀 Launch my own DeFi protocol. Right now, I'm mastering the architecture and security fundamentals to make that happen.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Smart Contracts:** Solidity, Foundry, Hardhat  
**Web3 Libraries:** Ethers.js, Wagmi, Viem  
**Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, RainbowKit  
**Focus Areas:** DeFi Protocols, Security Auditing, Token Economics

## 💡 Why Blockchain?

I got into crypto because I wanted to be early to something revolutionary. The combination of financial innovation and decentralized tech was too interesting to ignore. Three years in, I'm more convinced than ever that we're building the future of finance.
